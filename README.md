# crypto-slash-place

A crypto native version of r/place.

## Background

r/place was a collaborative project and social experiment hosted on the social networking site Reddit on April Fools' Day 2017 and repeated again on April Fools' Day 2022. The 2017 experiment involved an online canvas located at a subreddit called r/place, which registered users could edit the canvas by changing the color of a single pixel with a replacement from a 16-color palette.

crypto/place would model after this exact idea, except instead of registered users of reddit being able to change the color of pixels, users can change the color of pixels through crypto transactions.

## About Us

This project is developed and maintained by the Blockchain @ Hopkins club at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland.
